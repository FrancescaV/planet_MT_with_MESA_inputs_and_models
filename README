This folder contains the MESA input files used in:

"Tidally-driven Roche-Lobe Overflow of Hot Jupiters with MESA"
Francesca Valsecchi, Saul Rappaport, Frederic A. Rasio, Pablo Marchant, & Leslie A. Rogers

Specifically:

- binary_mass_transfer contains the inlist files used for the Roche-lobe 
overflow mass transfer calculations (see README for more details). 

- create_input_planet_model contains the inlist files used to create the input planetary
 models (see README for more details). 

- create_input_star_model contains the inlist files used to create the input stellar model.

- star_planet_models contains the input models used during the binary evolution calculation.
These have been created following the inlist files in create_input_planet_model 
and create_input_star_model mentioned above.

**************************************** Note ****************************************
To run a binary calculation, you only need the inlist files in binary_mass_transfer. 
For convenience, the input models needed for the calculation are provided in 
star_planet_models.
